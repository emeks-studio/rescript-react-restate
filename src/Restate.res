// type reducer<'state, 'action> = ('state, 'action) => 'state
// vs Restate Reducer "reduce" function:
type reducer<'state, 'action, 'deferredAction> = ('state, 'action) => update<'state, 'deferredAction>
// ^ Main difference is that our reduce function is wrapped in an custom "update" type.
type scheduler<'state, 'action, 'deferredAction> = (self<'state, 'action, 'deferredAction>, 'deferredAction) => option<unit => unit>
// ^ Scheduler is like an impure reducer that group the async/side effects actions related code.
//   But instead of dispatch actions inmmediatly, in their case, we differ them into a queue.

// This our the library internal actions we can dispatch.
// As you can see in the implementation, they act as a proxy to the user actions.
